# Hide-Instance
## What is this Hide-Instance? Hide-Instance is a script I made which can hide an Instance (also referred to as an object) preventing the game from accessing said Instance.

[source](/script/HideObject.lua)<br>^[\(raw\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechHog8984/Hide-Instance/main/script/HideObject.lua)

# Documentation:

## First, you have to get the actual "class":
```lua
    local HideObject = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechHog8984/Hide-Instance/main/script/HideObject.lua'))()
```
